rallydev-extension-bookmarklet
==============================

This is a bookmarklet which improves usability in RallyDev.

It overwrites calls to console.log and outputs them to its own console window.

Restrictions that made me to create this bookmarklet:
* Extensions are disabled in Chrome, so this couldn't be a browser extension loaded automatically.
* Developer Tools are disabled in Chrome, so the console and Inspect Element are not accessible.

Tested in and developed for Chrome.
